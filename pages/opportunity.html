				<h1>
						The Opportunity
					</h1>
					<p>123We see a tremendous opportunity to unite diverse viewpoints and ways of life across shared core values. At the most fundamental and operational level, this shared value is for sustainable development.  

		</p>
					<p>Sustainable development has a range of interpretations depending on the context in which it is used. We use the term loosely to exemplify the process by which humans learn to live in coexistence with the natural world, now and for generations to come. 

		
		</p>
					<p>Standard development models do little to assuage the perils of humanity’s current trajectory.  The intricate dance of carbon dioxide absorbing and re-releasing from the lungs of the planet is one that climate models are tenuous at predicting. Oil extraction, while promises steep returns, is not without devastating risks. Tourism and the service industry, while designed for the leisure traveler, often marginalize and homogenize local cultures.  

		</p>
					<p>The opportunity to live sustainably is at its essence something that must be learned. One way to seek knowledge is to ask questions: what does sustainability look like in the age of globalization? Where are the living repositories of knowledge needed to build on located? 
		</p>
					<p>One place to look is in the natural world and in cultures and ecosystems that have a deep history of sustainable existence. Many biodiversity hotspots around equatorial zones are inhabited by Indigenous people, over 300 million in number who are the native stewards of this land. Indigenous people are also keepers of the majority of the world’s cultural diversity--speaking 96% of known languages—half of which are predicted to go extinct this century.
</p>
					<p>Currently, inequality disproportionately affects indigenous people—chronic poverty, pointing to gaps in access to education and organized around gender and skilled labor coupled with increasing demand on natural resources in some of the world’s most biodiverse regions, is often in tension with indigenous rights under current models of development. We see the marginalization of demographics of people and environments at cross purposes with the desire to live in alignment with the core value of sustainable development. 
		
		</p>
					<p>Knowledge exchange is intrinsically about sharing power. By identifying indigenous knowledge as expertly situated in its context, we wish to learn from each other in an empathetic and culturally appropriate way. The opportunity to learn and integrate with diverse ways of knowing, including indigenous knowledge forms is tremendous.
