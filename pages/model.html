					<h1>Our Model</h1>
					<p>The endangerment of indigenous language and culture and the unmatched poverty of the world’s most marginalized populations is a burden felt beyond the isolation of indigenous communities. While indigenous people caretake 80% of the earth’s biodiversity, they are more resource poor than 85% of the earth’s population by enormous margins. Language, perhaps one of the oldest and most prized human inventions, has played a key evolutionary role in the innovation and transformation of humankind. As repositories for living knowledge, languages represent a map of the diverse territory’s humans have traversed across evolution. Currently, the many 7,000 languages spoken worldwide are immediately endangered and disappearing, many of which are no longer being taught to living descendants. By leveraging this innovative capacity of knowledge exchange through language our solution will bring the value of ancestral knowledge to bear on modern society’s reach for sustainability. Moreover, the history of the global market exclusion in indigenous territories point to the need for a new model. Our development model is a response to the extreme marginality of indigenous people.

				<p>
					As a development solution, our schools offer critical economic benefits to indigenous communities. They contribute to the development of sustainable infrastructure on indigenous land, access to basic services, sustainable employment and economic well-being.  

				</p>	
				<p>The complexity of sustainable development is approached widely through policy and economics--our model prioritizes operationalizing values, sharing power, and complying with uncertainty and emergence as agents of change. Specifically, our model is distinctive due to the following three elements: 

				</p>
					
			<h2>kinship ties 
		</h2>
		<p>ISFS relies on community kinship relations to offer immersive education in indigenous language and
		bioculture, while at the same time training and employing indigenous people in scientific data collection. The kinship component of the model reduces internal conflicts, which is a common cause of failure in community-based projects.

		<h2>Boundary Organization</h2>
		<p>Our model bridges four actors/sectors that are crucial for global sustainability, but rarely engaged with: indigenous communities, the global education industry, family businesses, and research institutions. We coordinate and bridge across these four sectors through innovative networking solutions.
		</p>
		<p>At the center of the ISFS business model are boundary organizations capable of bridging indigenous communities with international students. Boundary organization hold legitimacy, salience and credibility in both sides of the boundary.

		<h2>Organic Growth</h2>
		<p>Our business model is not mechanical, but organic. it cannot be replicated following a formula, but it requires the nurturing human relationships.
