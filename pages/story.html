					<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p>“If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.” -- Indigenous Australian artist Lilla Watson is credited with the quote, but prefers that it be credited to the collective aboriginal activist groups she’s a part of.
				
				</p>		
			
			<p>This statement of meaning points to the underlying premise of our work. Our development model is steeped in all facets of personal and societal sustainability.  The responsibility that each one of us has to identify our personal liberation--that which we are committed to, that which calls to us to act, a gift, passion or unique talent we are here to bring forth--this intrinsic motivation to act in alignment with our own liberation, is the starting point of our story. 
				
				</p>

			<p>Todd Dillon Swanson, with his Quichua wife, started the Andes and Amazon Field School (AAFS) in Ecuador 20 years ago. As a native to  Ecuador, Todd and his family have created the school as a means to support and enhance the livelihoods and safeguard the cultural traditions of their community through disseminating indigenous language and culture to foreign exchange language students.  Our development model is inspired by the success, and rooted in the principles set forth, by the AAFS. 
				
				</p>
			
			<p>We are currently implementing an ISFS pilot in the Waorani community of Gomatan (at the Curaray drainage of Napo-Amazon basin). This pilot is allowing us to test the model and demonstrate its capacity to make indigenous communities more sustainable. 
				
				</p>
				
			<p>Basic infrastructure to host students will be ready in the Summer of 2019, while language materials to teach Waorani and Achuar are currently being developed.
				
				</p>
			
			<p>We are seeking support to scale the ISFS model worldwide.
